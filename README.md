# QuantumHaskell

This is a re-implementation and modification of Jan Skibinsk's module
QuantumVector, obtained from https://wiki.haskell.org/Numeric_Quest
A copy of the original code is included.

Initially the code is simply a copy of Jan SKibinski's but with minor cosmetic changes.
The plan is to further modify the code using more abstract mathematics, and perhaps
even including simple analytical methods.
